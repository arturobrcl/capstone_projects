You are tasked with designing and implementing a real-time data processing pipeline for a streaming data application. The application receives a continuous stream of data from multiple sources and requires near real-time processing and analysis. The goal is to efficiently handle high-volume data ingestion, perform real-time data transformations, and store processed data for further analysis and reporting.
